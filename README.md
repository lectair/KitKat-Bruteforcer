<h1>KitKat Bruteforcer</h1>

This is a tool written in Python that attempts to get some working codes for the KitKat iPhone 11 raffle.

There are two modes, random and specific:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;- Random mode: Generates a random string with numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;- Specific mode: Generates a string with 6 uppercase letters, 3 lowercase letters and 1 number.

<h3>BETA - Threading:</h3>
You can set a number of threads to make it faster.<br>
This is still on beta phase so it doesn't work properly yet.
More than 1 or 2 threads doesn't usually work.
