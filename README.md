#KitKat Bruteforcer

This is a tool written in Python that attempts to get some working codes for the KitKat iPhone 11 raffle.

There are two modes, random and specific:
    - Random mode: Generates a random string with numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters.
    - Specific mode: Generates a string with 6 uppercase letters, 3 lowercase letters and 1 number.

#BETA - Threading:
You can set a number of threads to make it faster. This is still on beta phase so it doesn't work properly yet.
More than 1 or 2 threads doesn't usually work.
